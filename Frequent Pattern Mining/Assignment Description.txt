This question aims to provide you a better understanding of the frequent pattern mining
and the closed/maximal pattern mining.
1. Implement a frequent pattern mining algorithm (e.g., the Apriori algorithm or FPGrowth)
to mine the frequent patterns from a transaction dataset.
2. Implement a closed pattern mining algorithm to mine the closed frequent patterns
from the same transaction dataset. An easy way is to write code based on the frequent
patterns you got from part 1.
3. Implement a maximal pattern mining algorithm to mine the maximal frequent patterns
from the same transaction dataset. An easy way is to write code based on the frequent
patterns you got from part 1.
Input Format
The input dataset is a transaction dataset.
The first line of the input corresponds to the minimum support.
Each following line of the input corresponds to one transaction. Items in each transaction
are seperated by a space.
Please refer to the sample input below. In sample input 0, the minimum support is 2,
and the dataset contains 3 transactions and 5 item types (A, B, C, D and E).
Constraints
NA
Output Format
The output are the frequent patterns you mined out from the input dataset.
Each line of the output should be in the format:
Support [ f r e q u e n t pa t t e r n ]
Support [ f r e q u e n t pa t t e r n ]
. . . . . .
The frequent patterns should be ordered according to their support from largest to smallest.
Ties should be resolved by ordering the frequent patterns according to the alphabetical
order.
First print all the frequent patterns for part 1, then the closed frequent patterns for part
2 and last the maximal frequent patterns for part 3. Each part should be separated by an
empty line.
Please refer to the sample output below. In sample output 0, the first 9 patterns are the
frequent patterns for part 1, the following 3 patterns are the closed frequent patterns for
part 2 and the last 2 patterns are the maximal frequent patterns for part 3.
